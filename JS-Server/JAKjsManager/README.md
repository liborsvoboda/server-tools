# JAK - JAvascriptov√° Knihovna #

JAK is an open-sourced JavaScript toolkit, created by Seznam.cz, a.s. It aims to simplify development of recurring JS tasks. Several widgets are included. 

We use Jasmine BDD for testing the JAK core library. Available tests are in /tests. Testing JAK.Request needs properly configured PHP-enabled server side.

JAK is distributed under the terms of the [MIT licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

Jak.seznam.cz was shutdown due to obsolete information.
